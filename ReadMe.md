What is Python?

While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python’s Flying Circus.

At the height of its success, the Monty Python team were performing their sketches to live audiences across the world, including at the Hollywood Bowl.

Since Monty Python is considered one of the two fundamental nutrients to a programmer (the other being pizza), Python’s creator named the language in honor of the TV show.

Who created Python?


One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person’s work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception.

There are not many languages whose authors are known by name.

Python was created by Guido van Rossum, born in 1956 in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

Of course, van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself.

The speed with which Python has spread around the world is a result of the continuous work of thousands (very often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of them aren’t IT specialists) and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came to one head – Guido’s.


The circumstances in which Python was created are a bit puzzling. According to van Rossum:

In December 1989, I was looking for a “hobby” programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office (...) would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying Circus).

In 1999, Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:

an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;

open source, so anyone can contribute to its development;

code that is as understandable as plain English;

suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.


About 20 years later, it is clear that all these intentions have been fulfilled. Some sources say that Python is the third-most popular programming language in the world, while others claim it’s the fifth.

Either way, it still occupies a high rank in the top ten of the TIOBE Programming Community Index.

Python isn’t a young language. It is mature and trustworthy. It’s not a one-hit wonder. It’s a bright star in the programming firmament, and time spent learning Python is a very good investment.
